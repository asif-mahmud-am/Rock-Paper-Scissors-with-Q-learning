# Rock Paper Scissors

The 3 sectors of this project are as follows:
- ML algorithm: stems from Q-learning
- Backend: FastAPI application
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

We have also added *persistent session storage* in the backend so the algorithm can separate from user to user.

### Run
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Then open the HTML file `main.html`.

You should be all set.
